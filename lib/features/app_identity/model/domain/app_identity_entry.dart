/// Domain model of a custom desktop entry (shortcut).
///
/// One entry maps to one home-screen icon / Windows .lnk with its own name,
/// image, and a two-way state choice:
///
/// - [sharedWithDefault] TRUE: the entry is a pure icon/name ALIAS of the
///   default entry — it shares the SystemPlaying context and never owns a
///   workspace. The seed fields are hidden and unused.
/// - [sharedWithDefault] FALSE (default): the entry owns its OWN independently
///   saved "system playing" workspace (a [ScenarioKind.entryWorkspace] row),
///   so switching entries never disturbs each other or the default.
///
/// [seedScenarioId]/[seedTagId] are used ONLY to initialize the entry's own
/// workspace on the FIRST launch. They are never re-applied afterwards — by
/// then the underlying scenario/tag data may have changed a lot, so the entry
/// keeps its own evolving state instead.
