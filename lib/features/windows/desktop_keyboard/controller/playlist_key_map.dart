/// context-menu section of PotPlayer's official default shortcuts.

/// These bindings apply ONLY while a playlist-style list (the scenario queue /
/// preview) holds keyboard focus, and ONLY in the metadata-driven era. The list
/// OWNS them: the global player handler skips any key owned here, so e.g.
/// `↑/↓` navigate the list instead of changing volume.
///
/// Keys whose PotPlayer action has no IRIS equivalent are present as no-op
/// actions on purpose — consuming them keeps a conflicting global binding from
/// firing ("不绑定就是什么都不做").
///
/// Deliberately ABSENT (stay global): `Space` play/pause, `PgUp/PgDn`
/// prev/next file, `Enter` fullscreen, `←/→` seek, `F5` settings.
