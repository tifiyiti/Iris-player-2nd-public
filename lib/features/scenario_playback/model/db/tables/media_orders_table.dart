/// that is largely the SAME permutation stored N times. A shared order is built
/// once per (scope, sort, direction, grouping, media-type set) and every
/// scenario then stores only a membership bitmap over it; a scenario's base
/// order is the concatenation of its sources, each a FILTERED SUBSEQUENCE of

/// revision the order was built against, so a stale order is rebuilt rather
/// than silently serving a pre-scan ordering.
