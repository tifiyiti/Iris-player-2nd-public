/// on screen, so the natural key changes on every block switch. When the user
/// asked to treat the whole virtual video as one media
/// ([BgVmScopeMode.wholeVirtual]) the VM side publishes a stable identity here
/// instead, and the 副音 feature consumes it without knowing VM exists.

/// - no active VM session → null (ordinary single-file playback);
/// - [BgVmScopeMode.perBlock] → null: each block IS the current media, so the
///   anchor follows the physical file and a block switch is a media switch;
/// - [BgVmScopeMode.wholeVirtual] → the virtual video's identity, so internal

/// that was current when the tiling run started. A LATER virtual item (a
/// different key) falls back to the physical block identity, so under `smart`
/// only its blocks carrying a saved timeline trigger 副音. Null/empty means
/// "not pinned yet" and publishes the current item (the caller pins it).
