/// Right-edge overlay playlist dock for picture fullscreen (画面全屏).
///
/// PotPlayer-style: the panel slides in over the fullscreen video (occluding
/// it, never shrinking it). While hidden, a thin activation strip at the right
/// edge reveals it on hover; the pointer may then move into the panel and
/// operate it normally. Once the pointer leaves the panel plus
/// [kFullscreenDockHideMargin] px it hides again.
///
/// The hover zone is a SINGLE persistent region anchored to the right edge,
/// whose width is [edgeWidth] while hidden and the panel + margin while shown.
/// It must never be re-mounted under a stationary pointer: with the previous
/// design the strip only existed while hidden, so any transient conceal (e.g. a
/// fullscreen geometry change emitting `onExit` and then `onEnter` in the same
/// frame) re-revealed immediately — the panel looped reveal/conceal while the
/// cursor sat still on the edge. The panel visuals are a separate, moving child
/// that never owns hover, and a conceal is debounced by
/// [kFullscreenDockConcealDelay] so a brief skirting of the boundary is absorbed.
///
/// Reveal fires on both `onEnter` AND `onHover`: a conceal that lands while the
/// pointer is still inside the region leaves the annotation active, so no fresh
/// `onEnter` can arrive — movement within the region must be able to wake it.
/// Conversely an `onExit` whose reported position still lies inside the region
/// rect is spurious (media-switch rebuild burst, dialog barrier above the dock)
/// and must NOT conceal — see [shouldConcealAfterExit].
///
/// The summon strip EXCLUDES the control bar while the panel is hidden
/// ([controlPanelKey]): the one-handed side panel is anchored against this same
/// right edge, so an unfiltered hover summoned the queue over the slider the
/// user was reaching for. Once the panel is out it owns the strip — the two
/// rects overlap by design, so excluding them there would conceal the panel the
/// instant it appeared.
///
/// Purely presentational: visibility is owned by the caller ([shown]/[pinned])
/// so this widget can be exercised without the app's stores.
