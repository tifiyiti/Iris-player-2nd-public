///     the scenario happens to stream them in.
///   - A group's members and their order are therefore EXEMPT from the
///     external order: shuffling or re-sorting the scenario moves the merged
///     ROW, never which files it merges nor how its own segments sequence.
///   - The merged item then takes part in the external order as ONE element
///     (see `applyVmOverlay`, which places it at its earliest member).
///
/// Deriving the groups from the STREAM order instead (the old maximal-run
/// approximation) meant a shuffled stream scattered a group's members, so the
/// run pipeline split it into several rows while the persisted index stored
/// one: the row the list showed and the group the tap played were then two
/// different sets of files.
///
/// The run-based derivation is retired; `vmNoMatchReport` survives as the
/// diagnostic for "no rule matched anything", which the rule pipeline itself
/// reports only as an empty result.
