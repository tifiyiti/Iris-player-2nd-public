///
/// WHY BY FILE RECENCY (design intent — do not "optimize" this into a
/// positional lookup):
/// A merged group is a SYNTHETIC video the app invents on every resolve. Its
/// effective stream is recomputed whenever anything upstream moves (rule
/// edits, source add/remove, scenario/tag switch, shuffle, membership
/// changes), so the group's positional `scopeKey` and even its member list are
/// ephemeral: a re-resolve can shift, renumber or split a group without any
/// file moving. Only the FILE identity survives that — its `media_nodes` row
/// is keyed by `storageId:path` and keeps the real "last played" time.
/// Resuming by the newest `lastPlayedAt` therefore returns the user to the
/// actual file they were watching, and that file's own saved position is the
/// only offset that stays meaningful when the group's timeline changes.
/// (The legacy positional anchor in `virtual_media_states` is written but is
/// NOT authoritative for exactly this reason — see `_saveAnchor`.)
///
/// Among the group's segments, the one with the newest [SegmentProgress.lastPlayedAt]
/// wins; its own saved position becomes the intra-segment offset. A segment
/// watched through (`completed`) resumes from its head. No usable progress
/// anywhere → segment 0 start.
///
/// Deliberately identity-based: the group's positional `scopeKey` changes when
/// the stream is recomposed, but each file's own progress does not.
/// A caller that already knows the exact file (a per-context bookmark) can
/// override this through `targetMediaKey`; see [planVmSessionStart].
